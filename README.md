# tinyfs

A minimal simulated file system designed as a reverse engineering challenge for HITsz.

## Features

- Supports data compression using DEFLATE and RLE  
- Automatic compression and decompression  
- ~~Intentionally bad code quality~~  

## Solution?

I have no idea how to reverse itâ€”since I already implemented the file reading function, I can simply run my program and retrieve the flagðŸ˜œ
